<h4><b>Hello mate,</b></h4> 
<p style="text-align:justify">I'm Alex Sá, a Software Engineer student at University of Minho, with a passion for technology and cybersecurity. 
Currently, I'm on the last semester of my degree, diving deep into compilers and digital security.</p>

On this website, you will find everything relative to my <b>cybersecurity</b> journey.

<h1><b>Education</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li>Software Engineer Degree - <b><a href="https://www.uminho.pt/PT/ensino/oferta-educativa/Cursos-Conferentes-a-Grau/_layouts/15/UMinho.PortalUM.UI/Pages/CatalogoCursoDetail.aspx?itemId=5055&catId=15">University of Minho</a></b> (Sep/2022 - Jun/2025)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">My Software Engineering studies gave me a strong foundation in <b>programming</b>, exploring various <b>paradigms</b> (Functional, Imperative, Object-Oriented and Event-Driven), Non-Relational/Relational <b>databases</b>, <b>distributed systems</b>, <b>artificial intelligence</b>, <b>networks</b>, and <b>software development methodologies</b>. I gained hands-on experience with different <b>technologies and projects</b>, enhancing my skills such as analytical thinking, problem-solving and the ability 
to design efficient and scalable systems.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cybersecurity Master - TBD (Sep/2025 - Jun/2027)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">After completing my degree, I plan to pursue a master's in cybersecurity, as I see it as the next step in my career. This will allow me to deepen my theoretical knowledge and build a stronger foundation in the field. I haven’t yet decided on a specific institution, as I’m still exploring the best option for my goals.</p>

<h1><b>Cybersecurity</b></h1>

<ul>
    <li>Capture The Flag</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">My first contact with cybersecurity was through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which introduced me to security challenges in a hands-on and engaging way. These challenges sparked my interest in <b>forensics and reverse engineering</b>, allowing me to analyze binary files, investigate memory dumps, and uncover hidden data. Through these CTFs, I enhanced my attention to detail, gained a deeper understanding of security vulnerabilities, and developed a strong curiosity to explore the field further.</p>

<ul>
    <li>TryHackMe</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">After my experience with CTFs, I moved on to TryHackMe, a platform that offered a more structured approach to learning cybersecurity. There, I started exploring various rooms that provided both <b>theoretical and practical knowledge</b> in the field. TryHackMe allowed me to deepen my understanding of <b>foundational concepts</b>, such as network security, web vulnerabilities, and system exploitation, while applying them in controlled environments. This combination of theory and hands-on experience helped me solidify my cybersecurity skills and start working with common, everyday <b>tools</b> used in the industry.</p>

<ul>
    <li>HackTheBox</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">While I still used TryHackMe to reinforce my knowledge, I began integrating HackTheBox Academy and its main platform into my learning process. Through the academy, I focused on the theoretical modules of the <b>Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)</b> course. At the same time, I applied this knowledge by solving machines, where I learned various <b>penetration testing techniques</b>. In addition, I worked on Sherlocks, which allowed me to dive into <b>forensics</b>, enhancing my skills in data recovery, investigation, and analysis.</p>
